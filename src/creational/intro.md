# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are a set of patterns that deal with the object creation process. They focus on providing flexible ways to create objects, allowing for decoupling of object creation from their implementation. These patterns enhance the reusability, maintainability, and flexibility of a system's design by tailoring the object creation mechanisms to specific situations.

## Common Creational Design Patterns

1. <span class="usecase-heading">**Singleton**</span>: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created, providing a global point of access to that instance.

2. <span class="usecase-heading">**Builder**</span>: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

3. <span class="usecase-heading">**Factory**</span>: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

4. <span class="usecase-heading">**Prototype**</span>: Creates objects by cloning existing instances, avoiding the need for subclassing.

These are just a few examples of the creational design patterns commonly used in Rust. Each pattern addresses specific scenarios and provides unique benefits in terms of object creation and initialization. In the following sections, we will explore each pattern in detail, discussing their purpose, implementation, and usage in Rust.

## Benefits of Creational Design Patterns

- **Flexibility**: Creational design patterns enable the creation of objects in a flexible manner, adapting to the requirements of a given situation.

- **Decoupling**: By separating object creation from implementation, these patterns promote decoupling, reducing dependencies and making the system more maintainable.

- **Enhanced Reusability**: The use of creational design patterns often results in code that is more reusable, allowing for the creation of objects in various contexts.

- **Improved Design and Architecture**: These patterns contribute to better overall system design and architecture by providing more suitable and effective ways of creating objects.
