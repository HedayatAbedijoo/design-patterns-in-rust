# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are a set of patterns that deal with the object creation process. They focus on providing flexible ways to create objects, allowing for decoupling of object creation from their implementation. These patterns enhance the reusability, maintainability, and flexibility of a system's design by tailoring the object creation mechanisms to specific situations.

## Common Creational Design Patterns

1. <span class="usecase-heading">**Singleton**</span>: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created, providing a global point of access to that instance.

2. <span class="usecase-heading">**Builder**</span>: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

3. <span class="usecase-heading">**Factory**</span>: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

4. <span class="usecase-heading">**Prototype**</span>: Creates objects by cloning existing instances, avoiding the need for subclassing.

These are just a few examples of the creational design patterns commonly used in Rust. Each pattern addresses specific scenarios and provides unique benefits in terms of object creation and initialization. In the following sections, we will explore each pattern in detail, discussing their purpose, implementation, and usage in Rust.

# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the composition and relationships between classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. They help in organizing and simplifying the relationships between different components of a system, promoting modularity, flexibility, and reusability. These patterns facilitate the design and maintenance of software systems by providing solutions for structural challenges such as managing complex relationships, adapting interfaces, or separating abstractions from their implementations.

## Common Structural Design Patterns

1. <span class="usecase-heading">**Adapter Pattern**</span>: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows incompatible classes to work together by wrapping the adaptee with a compatible interface.

2. <span class="usecase-heading">**Bridge Pattern**</span>: Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It helps in decoupling an abstraction from its implementation details, promoting flexibility.

3. <span class="usecase-heading">**Composite Pattern**</span>: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, simplifying the interaction between them.

4. <span class="usecase-heading">**Decorator Pattern**</span>: Dynamically adds new behaviors or responsibilities to an object by wrapping it in a decorator class. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

5. <span class="usecase-heading">**Facade Pattern**</span>: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand. It hides the complexity of the underlying system and offers a unified interface.

6. <span class="usecase-heading">**Flyweight Pattern**</span>: Shares common state between multiple objects to reduce memory usage. It allows for efficient representation of large numbers of fine-grained objects.

7. <span class="usecase-heading">**Proxy Pattern**</span>: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows for additional functionalities or restrictions to be applied to an object without changing its core implementation.

These patterns, among others, offer solutions for various structural challenges and can be applied in different scenarios to improve the design and architecture of software systems.

# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects, providing solutions for effectively managing complex behaviors and relationships. These patterns emphasize the collaboration and coordination between objects to achieve specific functionalities, such as defining communication protocols, encapsulating algorithms, or handling varying behaviors. They help in designing flexible and maintainable systems by promoting loose coupling, reusability, and extensibility.

## Common Behavioral Design Patterns

Here are some common behavioral design patterns:

1. <span class="usecase-heading">**Observer Pattern**</span>: Allows objects to subscribe and receive updates from a subject when its state changes, enabling loose coupling between the subject and observers.

2. <span class="usecase-heading">**State Pattern**</span>: Enables an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating different states as separate classes and allowing for easy state transitions.

3. <span class="usecase-heading">**Strategy Pattern**</span>: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates each algorithm separately, allowing them to be used interchangeably based on specific requirements.

4. <span class="usecase-heading">**Command Pattern**</span>: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing or logging requests, and supporting undoable operations.

5. <span class="usecase-heading">**Visitor Pattern**</span>: Separates the algorithm from the objects it operates on, allowing new operations to be added to the object structure without modifying the objects themselves.

6. <span class="usecase-heading">**Iterator Pattern**</span>: Provides a way to sequentially access elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation, allowing iteration over various data structures.

7. <span class="usecase-heading">**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**</span>: Decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, forming a chain of objects that can handle the request dynamically, giving each receiver the chance to process the request or pass it to the next receiver.

8. <span class="usecase-heading">**Mediator Pattern**</span>: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling between objects by centralizing their communication through the mediator.

9. <span class="usecase-heading">**Memento Pattern**</span>: The Memento pattern allows an object to capture its internal state and store it externally, without violating encapsulation. It provides the ability to restore the object's state to a previous state.

10. <span class="usecase-heading">**Interpreter Pattern**</span>: Defines a representation of grammar and an interpreter to evaluate sentences in the language, enabling the interpretation of a language or expression.

11. <span class="usecase-heading">**Template Pattern**</span>: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm while keeping the overall structure intact.

These patterns provide solutions to common challenges in managing behaviors, interactions, and communication between objects, promoting flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability in software systems.
